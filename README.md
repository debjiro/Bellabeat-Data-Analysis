## Recommendations

#### Increase Physical Activity:
Encourage users to aim for at least 10,000 steps per day to improve overall health.

#### Improve Sleep Quality:
Suggest bedtime routines and sleep hygiene practices to help users get better sleep.

#### Personalized Insights:
Provide personalized health insights and recommendations based on individual user data.

#### Encourage Weight Tracking:
Only 8 users have recorded their weight data. Encouraging more users to regularly log their weight can help in providing better health insights and tracking progress over time.


#### Promote Consistent Usage:
Due to inconsistencies in data logging due to irregular usage of the app and devices, we can implement features that motivate users to consistently log their data, such as streaks, badges, and rewards for continuous usage.

## Further Analysis Ideas:
